`galilei` is a software package that makes emulating a function easier. The motivation of emulating a function is that sometimes computing a function could be a time consuming task, so one may need to find fast approximations of a function that's better than basic interpolation techniques. It builds on the ideas of
[cosmopower](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower) and [axionEmu](https://github.com/keirkwame/axionEmu), with an aim to be as generic and flexible as possible on the emulating target. As such, `galilei` can take any generic parametrized function that returns an array without a need to know its implementation detail.

## Installation
```
pip install galilei
```

## Basic usage
Suppose that we have an expensive function that we want to emulate
```python
def test(a=1, b=1):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    return np.sin(a*x) + np.sin(b*x)
```
If you want to emulate this function, you can simply add a decorator `@emulate` and supply the parameters that you want to evaluate this function at to build up the training data set.

```python
from galilei import emulate

@emulate(samples={
    'a': np.random.rand(1000),
    'b': np.random.rand(1000)
})
def test(a=1, b=1):
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    return np.sin(a*x) + np.sin(b*x)
```
Here we are just making 1000 pairs of random numbers from 0 to 1 to train our function. When executing these lines, the emulator will start training, and once it is done, the original `test` function will be automatically replaced with the emulated version and should behave in the same way, except much faster!
```
